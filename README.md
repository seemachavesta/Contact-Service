Contact Service
This repository contains the Contact Service implementation from Project One, showcasing my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The included files—Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, and ContactServiceTest.java—demonstrate my ability to write and execute JUnit tests to ensure functionality and reliability.

To ensure my code is functional and secure, I followed unit testing best practices, validated inputs, and handled edge cases to prevent failures. By carefully analyzing user requirements, I designed the contact service to enforce constraints on contact ID, name, and phone number, ensuring data integrity. My approach to software design prioritizes clarity, modularity, and maintainability, making it easier to test and enhance functionality over time.

This project reflects my growth in software development and testing, reinforcing the importance of structured testing and quality assurance in building robust applications.
